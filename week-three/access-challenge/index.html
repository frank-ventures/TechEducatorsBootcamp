          <h3>The Tower of Hercules Lighthouse</h3>
          <h4>Spain</h4>
          <p>
            This ancient Roman lighthouse has gained recognition as a UNESCO
            World Heritage Site. It can be found towering over the entrance of
            La Coruña harbor in northwestern Spain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tower of Hercules has served as a lighthouse and landmark at the
            entrance of La Coruña harbour in north-western Spain since the late
            1st century A.D. when the Romans built the Farum Brigantium. The
            Tower, built on a 57 metre high rock, rises a further 55 metres, of
            which 34 metres correspond to the Roman masonry and 21 meters to the
            restoration directed by architect Eustaquio Giannini in the 18th
            century

          <h3>Kermorvan Lighthouse</h3>
          <h4>France</h4>
          <p>Kermorvan Lighthouse was built in 1849.</p>
          <p>
            Located at the tip of the peninsula of the same name (which is
            classified and managed by the Conservatoire du littoral), renowned
            for its beautiful walks, the Kermorvan lighthouse is a privileged
            spot offering a breathtaking view of the Iroise Sea. Once you've
            climbed the 77 steps, a superb panorama of the port of Le Conquet,
            Pointe Saint-Mathieu, the islands and the Trézien lighthouse will
            unfold before you. The lighthouse is 20.35 metres high. The rotating
            optical assembly produces a steady white flash every 5 seconds.

          <h3>Diamond Head Lighthouse</h3>
          <h4>Hawaii</h4>
          <p>
            Located on the southern cliffs of the island, its red light can be
            seen 17 nautical miles (over 31 kilometers) from the shoreline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before navigational structures were built in Hawaii, large bonfires
            guided mariners safely ashore. The lighthouse locations, Diamond
            Head was named by British sailors that mistook the crystals they
            found, while they climbed the volcano's slopes, for diamonds.
            Building lighthouses on Oahu were planned after two large ships ran
            aground in 1893 and 1897.

          <h3>Kovalam Beach Lighthouse</h3>
          <h4>India</h4>
          <p>
            Kovalam Beach Lighthouse is so pretty that the beach it sits on —
            Lighthouse Beach — was named after it. Vistors can climb 142 steps
            to the top to see expansive views of Poovar Island and the famous
            Beemapalli mosque.
          </p>
          <p>It started functioning on 30 June 1972.</p>
