# Week One Project

Build out the website!

I've chosen to build my website around an eco-friendly campsite opening in Spain.

I generally found it OK to create the structure of the website.

There were a few pointers I borrowed, and new things I learned from the example website.
I've not used the 'gap' CSS attribute before and found that useful for directing space exactly where I needed it in the header.
I read this to get some further info: https://w3things.com/blog/margin-vs-padding-vs-gap/

I quite liked how the header stayed fixed, and thought the translucent background it had was a nice effect.

I struggled to find a happy solution to the 'width' of my header. Upon 'inspecting' that element, the padding shows on the top, left, and bottom but I can't see the right edge of the headers padding.
Maybe this is characteristic of it taking up 100% of the page width.

I edited the styling of the buttons in the header, namely giving them a distinct look with a different colour and made them more noticeable with a border.

I got some pseudo-classes working for the anchors, using 'hover' and 'active'.

Through the page, I adjusted the 'font-weight' attribute down to give my text a bit more of a sleek and modern look.

I centered the pages <a> elements over their respective text boxes, with help from here: https://www.codeguage.com/courses/css/transformations-translation

The footer is very basic. Keeping it simple!
